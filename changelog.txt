   = Spectators will no longer be "found" when staying up without a bed. Creative mode unchanged for now
   = Turning on spectator when being found will cancel the effect as though near a bed
   = Death effects now target non-creative, non-spectator players, rather than just survival
   = Localized the morning chime so it can be heard with sound physics installed
   = Generally enhanced code for multiplayer use
   = Made exhaustion effects last 35 seconds to cover gaps between applications
   = Made room counter more accurate by disallowing additional markers when beds are nearly adjacent. "same room" sleeping
   - Reduced room size requirement by 1 block - beds must now be 4 blocks apart instead of 5
   - Slightly reduced the time for the bonus anti-exhaustion effect from sleeping (15m -> 10m)
   + Made used beds no longer safe by morning even by "sleeping" in them
   + Made used beds kick the player out if they are being targeted for being without a bed
   + Fixed a bug that caused the pack to only target the first player in the list in multiplayer
   + Fixed a bug that caused firetick and weathercycle to permanently freeze
   + Fixed the death sound effect
